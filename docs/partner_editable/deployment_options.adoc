This Quick Start only provides an end-to-end deployment option, which means it builds a new VPC, a set of subnets, NAT gateways, an internet gateway, security groups, bastion hosts, and other components for you. To set up the necessary networking and routing infrastructure, provide only the CIDR block for the VPC that you want to create.

NOTE: You can configure instance types and software settings, such as user names and passwords, as discussed later in this guide.
