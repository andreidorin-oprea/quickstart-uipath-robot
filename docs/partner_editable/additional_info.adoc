If you provided a UiPath Orchestrator URL during deployment, log in to UiPath Orchestrator. Then, verify that the UiPath Robot is present and connected to the tenant.

The deployment creates a *MODERN* directory called *AWSDeployed*, which contains UiPath Robot.

* For an unattended UiPath software robot, the *STATUS* is *N/A* because the new local administrator account is not yet logged in. However, you can run jobs.
* For an attended UiPath software robot, the *STATUS* is *DISCONNECTED* because the built-in administrator account is not logged in.

Access the UiPath Robot VM from the bastion host to check that it is deployed successfully. Connect to an attended UiPath software robot through the administrator account. To retrieve the password, use your private key. For an unattended robot, retrieve the user account from the *Robots* page in UiPath Orchestrator. The user format is `domain/username` or `machinename/username`. Use the same password you used during deployment.

== Create a key pair

Amazon EC2 uses public-key cryptography to encrypt and decrypt login information. In Windows instances, the key pair obtains the administrator password from the Amazon EC2 console and then logs in using RDP. On Linux, the key pair authenticates the SSH (Secure Shell) login. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances^].

To create a key pair in your preferred Region, do the following:

[start=1]
. In your AWS Management Console, choose an AWS Region.
. On the *Services* menu, choose *EC2*.
. Under *Network and Security*, choose *Key Pairs*.
. Choose *Create Key Pair*.
. Enter a name and choose *Create*.

== Create IAM user

A user login with programmatic access to following AWS services is required to launch the Quick Start CloudFormation stack.

* AWS CloudFormation
* AWS IAM, Amazon EC2
* Amazon S3
* AWS Lambda
* AWS Storage Gateway.

NOTE: If you do already have an IAM user with full access to these services, or have administrator access, you can skip this section.

[start=1]
:xrefstyle: short
. If you do not already have such an IAM user, https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users_create.html#id_users_create_console[create one^] from AWS console. In <<cfnuser>>, a user is created with programmatic and console access.

== Best practices for using {partner-product-short-name} on AWS
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

=== High availability and disaster recovery
Amazon EC2 provides the ability to place instances in multiple locations composed of AWS Regions and Availability Zones. Regions are dispersed and located in separate geographic areas. Availability Zones are distinct locations within a Region isolated from failures in other Availability Zones. They provide inexpensive, low-latency network connectivity to other Availability Zones in the same Region.

To make sure that an application is closer to certain customers, or for legal or design requirements, you can launch instances in separate Regions. By launching your instances in separate Availability Zones, you can protect your applications from the failure of a single location. Microsoft Exchange provides infrastructure features that complement the high availability and disaster recovery (DR) scenarios supported in the AWS Cloud.

The Quick Start also provides the option to deploy into a minimum of two Availability Zones. This option mitigates the loss of quorum in the case of a failure of a single node. However, you can choose this option only in AWS Regions that include two or more Availability Zones. For a current list of Availability Zones, see https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure/[AWS Global Infrastructure^].

To customize UiPath software for your business, IT, and security requirements, consult the https://docs.uipath.com/[UiPath Documentation Portal^].

== Security
// Provide post-deployment best practices for using the technology on AWS, including considerations such as migrating data, backups, ensuring high performance, high availability, etc. Link to software documentation for detailed information.

=== Security groups and firewalls
When Amazon EC2 instances are launched, they must be associated with a security group, which acts as a stateful firewall. You have complete control over the security group’s inbound and outbound network traffic. You can build granular rules that are scoped by protocol, port number, and source/destination IP address, or other security groups. By default, all outbound traffic from security group is permitted. Inbound traffic, however, must be configured to allow the appropriate traffic to reach your instances. We recommend that you tightly control inbound traffic. Doing this reduces the attack surface of your EC2 instances yet leaves the following ports open for application communication.

*UiPath Robot TCP ports*

:xrefstyle: short
[#security1]
.TCP ports
image::../images/security1.png[security1,width=50%,height=50%]

* 3389 for RDP access
* 443 for communication with UiPath Orchestrator

This Quick Start configures the following security groups:

[cols="25,25,25,25",grid="rows",frame="topbot", options="header"]
|===
|Security group
|Associated with
|Inbound source
|Ports

|StackName-SecurityStack-RobotSecurityGroup

|0.0.0.0/0
|Inbound: 443, 3389 +
Outbound: any ports

For more information, see https://docs.uipath.com/orchestrator/docs/security-best-practices[Security Best Practices^]. 

//Provide any other information of interest to users, especially focusing on areas where AWS or cloud usage differs from on-premises usage.

=== Security of the AWS infrastructure
AWS provides a set of building blocks, such as Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC, that you can use to provision your application’s infrastructure. AWS operates under a shared security responsibility model. AWS is responsible for the security of the underlying cloud infrastructure and you are responsible for securing workloads you deploy in AWS. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/whitepapers/latest/introduction-aws-security/introduction-aws-security.pdf[Introduction to AWS Security^].
