UiPath Robot is an agent that runs processes you develop in UiPath Studio. 

With this Quick Start, you can take advantage of the elasticity of the AWS Cloud to set up, operate, and scale robotic process automation (RPA). The architecture AWS offers provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity to scale your robots to meet your business needs. Each UIPath Robot deploys on one Amazon EC2 instance


in an architecture based on AWS best practices for security and high availability. AWS provides cost-efficient and resizable capacity, and scales resources to meet your specific workload. This Quick Start also offers . For more information, see link:#_architecture[Architecture], later in this guide.


With this Quick Start, you can deploy the following types of UiPath Robots:

*	Attended Robot: This type is triggered by user events and operates alongside a user by sharing the same workstation. Attended Robots are used with Orchestrator for centralized process deployment and logging. They can also add data to a processing queue for Unattended Robots.
*	Unattended Robot: This type runs in a virtual environment and can automate any number of processes. In addition to the capabilities of an Attended Robot, 
//TODO Why is Orchestrator mentioned? Needs more context.
Orchestrator is responsible for remote execution, monitoring, scheduling, and providing support for work queues.

You can run debugging processes in UiPath Studio using either Robot type.

Amazon may share user-deployment information with the AWS Partner that collaborated with AWS on the Quick Start.
