UiPath Robot is an execution agent that enables you to run processes developed in UiPath Studio.
The Robot is split into several components, and each component is dedicated to a particular automation task. The Robot components are as follows:

*	https://docs.uipath.com/robot/docs/robot-service[Robot Service^]
**	Service Mode
**	User Mode
*	https://docs.uipath.com/robot/docs/robot-executor[Robot Executor^]
*	https://docs.uipath.com/robot/docs/robot-agent[Robot Tray^]
*	https://docs.uipath.com/robot/docs/robot-command-line-interface[Robot Command Line Interface^]
*	https://docs.uipath.com/robot/docs/uipath-assistant[About UiPath Assistant^]

Splitting up the components helps developers, support users, and computers run, identify, and track the activity of each process. Custom behaviors, such as setting up different Firewall rules for the Robot Executor and Robot Service, can be configured for each component.

This Quick Start reference deployment allows you to deploy the following types of Robots:

*	Attended Robot: This type is triggered by user events and operates alongside a user by sharing the same workstation. Attended Robots are used with Orchestrator for centralized process deployment and logging. They can also add data to a processing queue for Unattended Robots.
*	Unattended Robot: This type runs in a virtual environment and can automate any number of processes. In addition to the capabilities of an Attended Robot, 
//TODO Why is Orchestrator mentioned? Needs more context.
Orchestrator is responsible for remote execution, monitoring, scheduling, and providing support for work queues.

You can run debugging processes in UiPath Studio using either Robot type.

Amazon may share user-deployment information with the AWS Partner that collaborated with AWS on the Quick Start.
