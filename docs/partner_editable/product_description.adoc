UiPath Robot is the agent that runs processes designed in UiPath Studio. A UiPath Robot is split into several components, each being dedicated to a particular automation task. This design allows you to run, identify, and track the work of each component. With UIPath Robots, you can capture data from user interfaces, manipulate applications, and communicate with other systems to perform repetitive business processes. Depending on its license, a UiPath software robot can be attended or unattended. For more information, see https://docs.uipath.com/robot/docs/introduction[Introduction] in the UiPath Robot Guide.
