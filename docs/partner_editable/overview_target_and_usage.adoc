This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying UiPath Robot on AWS. This Quick Start deploys UiPath Robot, the agent that runs processes designed in UiPath Studio. UiPath software robots must be connected to UiPath Orchestrator in order to execute processes, or they have to be licensed locally. The type of robot you have at your disposal is determined by its license, while the robot service is determined by the deployment. For more information, see https://docs.uipath.com/robot/docs/about-licensing[About Licensing].

TIP: This Quick Start deploys UiPath Robot. UiPath software robots can be deployed, secured, and managed at scale using UiPath Orchestrator, the centralized robot management tool from UiPath. A Quick Start reference deployment for https://fwd.aws/DqQDx[UiPath Orchestrator on the AWS Cloud] is also available.
