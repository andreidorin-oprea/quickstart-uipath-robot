This Quick Start reference deployment guide provides step-by-step instructions for deploying UiPath Robot on AWS. UiPath Robot is the implementation agent of the UiPath robotic process automation (RPA) suite. Whereas automation processes are designed in UiPath Studio, these processes are run by UiPath Robot. UiPath software robots can be deployed, secured, and managed at scale using UiPath Orchestrator, the centralized robot management tool from UiPath.

TIP: This Quick Start deploys UiPath Robot. A Quick Start reference deployment for https://fwd.aws/DqQDx[UiPath Orchestrator on the AWS Cloud] is also available.
