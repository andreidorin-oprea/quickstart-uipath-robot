==== Prepare your AWS account

===== Key pair 
Ensure that at least one Amazon EC2 key pair exists in your AWS account in your Region. Note the key-pair name because you will need it during deployment. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/ec2-key-pairs.html[Amazon EC2 key pairs and Linux instances^]. +
For testing or proof-of-concept purposes, we recommend creating a new key pair instead of using one thatâ€™s already in use by a production instance.
